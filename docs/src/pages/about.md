In my day job, I am a consultant in SmartGrid technologies for power utilities.

I started my career as a software engineer many decades ago when none of the fancy frameworks,
languages and tools existed.  Using a single board computer with 128K of ROM and 64K of RAM was more 
common.  I developed a solid expertise in real-time control systems to manage powergrids and
over time, became a consultant to power utilities.

As a sideline, by night (many, many nights), I have developed _[enofily](https://www.enofily.com)_ which is a website and mobile app for wine critics
and wine lovers to organize their tasting notes.

The side-effect of this was that I rediscovered how much writing software is fun.  The biggest
challenge was to learn the latest technologies.  There is still a lot to learn.

I am using the Zend Framework for the _enofily_ website and React Native for the mobile app.
It is backed by a MySQL database.  The website frontend is using AngularJs but I will be moving
to React to maintain a common code base with the mobile app.

Overtime, I have developed a good knowledge of:
 * PHP
 * Javascript
 * Laminas Framework for the site
 * Apigility for the api
 * MySQL
 * Apache
 * React
 * React Native
 * AngularJS
 * Webpack
 * Babel
 * and a bunch of antiquated stuff like assembler, C, Fortran, Pascal, VMS, Unix (yep, I am that old...)

 
I am opened to contract based software development engagement.
