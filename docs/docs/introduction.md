# Introduction

`laminas-webpack` is a Laminas MVC module to automate the loading of scripts and assets bundles
generated by Webpack to views.

This package is particularly useful when each MVC view requires a specific bundle to be loaded.

It works in tandem with the `php-webpack-plugin`, a Webpack plugin that builds a bundle manifest as a PHP associative
array that is consumed by `laminas-webpack`.

Documentation for `php-webpack-plugin` is available [here](https://github.com/visto9259/php-webpack-plugin).
