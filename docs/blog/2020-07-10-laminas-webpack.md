title: Laminas Framework and Webpack integration

If you are using Laminas MVC and want to also use Webpack to bundle and manage 
dependencies in your frontend Javascript, I wrote a [guide](/docs/zend-webpack-guide-getting-started) that
explains how to use the [`zend-webpack`](https://github.com/visto9259/zend-webpack) Laminas module and [`php-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/visto9259/php-webpack-plugin)
Webpack plugin to integrate and automate the bundling of frontend JS scripts in a Laminas Mvc application.

This is a replacement for `zend-webpack` which is now abandoned.
