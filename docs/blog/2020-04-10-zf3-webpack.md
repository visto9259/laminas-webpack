title: Zend Framework and Webpack integration

If you are using ZF3 MVC and want to also use Webpack to bundle and manage 
dependencies in your frontend Javascript, I wrote a [guide](/docs/zend-webpack-guide-getting-started) that
explains how to use the [`zend-webpack`](https://github.com/visto9259/zend-webpack) ZF3 module and [`php-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/visto9259/php-webpack-plugin)
Webpack plugin to integrate and automate the bundling of frontend JS scripts in a ZF3 Mvc application.

I hope you find it useful.
